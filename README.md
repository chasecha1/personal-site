This is the first iteration of my personal website.

## Stack
1. This is a Next.js application using the app router
2. Sanity - uses Sanity Studio for guestbook management and blog posts
3. Tailwind CSS - all components are styled with help from tailwind
4. Vercel - This site is being deployed on Vercel

## Goals
My motivation for this website was to build an interactive platform for me to share my thoughts and things I am experimenting with, primarily through the post page. I also wanted to showcase some of the work I've been doing, as seen through the project component.

## Not Finished
This site is not entirely finished. There are still a few things I want to try out and add in the future. Here are a couple features I want to add incremently:
1. A better contact me section - I've been researching tools like Nodemailer or EmailJS in order to build a contact me component where you write and send your email message directly in the site instead of clicking a link to my email
2. I plan on adding spam protection/word filtering to the guestbook submissions to better protect the page. I ultimately want to learn more about best practices surrounding form input such as this so will work on filtering/better checks for the submissions.
3. Animations - I think it could be cool to experiment more with animations on the page, primarily loading animations.
4. Video content - For projects I am not hosting anymore, I would like to provide videos so people can see walkthroughs of the project instead of just looking at the source code.
